Installation
============

GDBase relies on:

* gdb-6.8				http://sourceware.org/gdb/
* sqlite-3.5.9			http://www.sqlite.org/
* tcl-8.4.19			http://www.tcl.tk/
* postgresql-8.3.3		http://www.postgresql.org/
* Python-2.5.2			http://www.python.org/
* PyGreSQL-3.8.1		http://www.druid.net/pygresql/

The versions listed above have been tested with GDBase but earlier versions
will likely work as well. If you have these installed already you're all
set. Set GDBASE_PREFIX to your install directory and run:

	make
	make install

If you plan on using the postgres database to collect your debugging
information you will need to config gdbase for your server. Currently, no
config file exists and you must edit the `src/dbmerge.c` file. On line 73
you will see something like this:

	conn = PQconnectdb("dbname=OPD host=hpcdb.local port=5432 user=opd password=opd123");

Change the information to match your needs.
